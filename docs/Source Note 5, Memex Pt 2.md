Gorman, Michael E., and W. Bernard Carlson. "Interpreting invention as a cognitive process: The case of Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and the telephone." _Science, Technology, & Human Values_ 15, no. 2 (1990): 131-164.
The history that goes into one of the largest developments of the past few centuries will never *not * be interesting. At the time, they clearly had no idea how groundbreaking this would be, and how much this would spur a total change in life as they knew it.

This makes me reflect on today's world and how much [[innovation]] is occurring every day. With so much resources being dedicated to advancing and furthering [[technological]] bounds, the next Graham Bell could be among us today. Who knows when the next world changing invention is going to be invented, or if it already has? It's a strange concept, but look how far we've come in only 20 years!

> Through the summer of 1876, Bell gave several public demonstrations ofhis telephone, including an exhibition at the Philadelphia Centennial. WithHubbard, Bell approached Western Union and offered to sell his telephonefor $100,000.~ During the fall, Western Union, Hubbard, and Bell discussedthe possible purchase of this invention, but eventually negotiations broke off.In all likelihood, William Orton, president of Western Union, did not wish tonegotiate with Hubbard, an outspoken enemy of his company. But beyondthis personal animosity, the leaders of Western Union decided that there wasno need to buy Bell’s patent because the telephone could be easily duplicatedand improved by inventors already associated with the company. By thetechnical standards of the telegraph industry, Bell’s first telephones werepathetically crude (Figure 7) and Western Union managers were probablyconfident that their inventors could design a better telephone.[^1]
