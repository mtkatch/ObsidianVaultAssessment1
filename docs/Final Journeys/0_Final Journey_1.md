One of the most important things that I have learned throughout this course is to acknowledge and appreciate the physicality of the Internet Before I started this course, I was ignorant to the fact that the Internet has immense physical roots, and without those roots, we wouldn’t have access to the technology that we enjoy today.

In a course titled history of the Internet, it’s only fitting that one of the most powerful aspects that I took away personally has to do with the tangibility of this mass innovation in society. Now, instead of believing that the Internet was some invisible and omnipresent existence in my life, I can appreciate all of the work, the development in the field, and the early pioneers of the Internet who helped blaze the trail.

The physicality of the internet and it's roots have promoted a unique aspect of our society, and one that undoubtedly promotes connection. It both encourages and requires a shared, collective mindset where helping your fellow user is an important pillar of the internet.

This journey, from the physical developments and innovation of the internet infrastructure has led to a massive project shared by countless people across the globe via technology, and that is a deeply resounding and important connection for me.
