I've always heard about Alan Turing from The Imitation Game and Ex Machina (Will refer to that in a separate note), but hearing his excerpts are very intriguing. He was a truly creative individual, who saw his field in a different way than everyone else. Using real life examples and ideas to inspire his [[technological]] innovations is truly incredible.

> Instead of trying to produce a programme to simu-late the adult mind, why not rather try to produceone which simulates the child’s? If this were thensubjected to an appropriate course of education onewould obtain the adult brain. Presumably the childbrain is something like a notebook as one buys itfrom the stationers. Rather little mechanism, andlots of blank sheets. (Mechanism and writing arefrom our point of view almost synonymous.) Ourhope is that there is so little mechanism in thechild brain that something like it can be easily pro-grammed. The amount of work in the education wecan assume, as a first approximation, to be muchthe same as for the human child[^1]
