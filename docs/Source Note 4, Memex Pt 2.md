Transatlantic Cable

Alexander, Matthew. "Laying the first transatlantic cable." _Proto-Type_ 1 (2013).

An amazing testament to human [[innovation]] and the ability to create massive infrastructure.  I couldn't even imagine what this process could have been like at the time. In a period with not only significantly less technology, but a significantly under-developed field altogether. Such a massive project must have taken such careful planning, countless hours of work, and extreme dedication from everyone involved. This was truly the beginning of a whole new era in human society, as this was one of the building blocks of modern communication, effectively changing the trajectory of technology going forward. Really cool stuff that makes you appreciative of the [[technological]] marvels we take advantage of today.

> The electrical telegraph was a system developed to transmit written messages through a wireusing electrical signals in the early 1800s. In the United Kingdom the telegraph had been in use on therailroads as early as 1837, the first system in North America was built in 1844 and by 1851 a cable waslaid across the English Channel. [1]In 1852 Frederick N. Gisborne laid the first deep-sea cable in North America between NewBrunswick and Prince Edward Island. Gisborne had proposed another cable between New York and St.John’s that would form a relay system where messages would be sent by telegraph to St. John’s andthen carried by boat to Europe and vice versa. Construction of this system was halted when Gisborneencountered financial difficulty crossing the rough interior of Newfoundland. Gisborne travelled toNew York looking for more investors to complete the project where he met Cyrus W. Field. Field tookover the project and immediately began investigating the feasibility of a transatlantic cable betweenNewfoundland and Ireland. [2][3]Field founded the New York, Newfoundland and London Electric Telegraph Company in 1854and finished cable between New York and Newfoundland by 1856. It was then demonstrated using therelay scheme that 2 to 3 days could be saved transmitting messages across the Atlantic Ocean whichshowed the potential of a transatlantic cable and garnered more interest in the project. Field thenfounded the Atlantic Telegraph Company where William Thompson (Lord Kelvin) and WildmanWhitehouse became involved. [3][^1]
