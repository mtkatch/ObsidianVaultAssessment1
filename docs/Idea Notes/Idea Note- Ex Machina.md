As you can tell, I really love cinema, and the content in this course is letting me return to appreciate how many a propos and related films there are. I really love the film Ex Machina, directed by Alex Garland. A modern sci-fi masterpiece that centers around the [[Turing]] Test, and the surrounding [[ethics]]. It asks several quesitons on the development of robotics and is very fitting in relation to both the course, as well as life today. How far is too far? Even if we could, should we? (Jurrasic Park, but you knew that)
