All of this talk of [[technological]] advances is making me extremely excited for Christopher Nolan's upcoming film Oppenheimer. I really love movies, and this is a great intersection between the course content and my own personal interests. Nolan, known for his incredible practical effects throughout his films, plans to replicate the Trinity test! The discussion on [[nuclear]] tests made me reflect on these advancements and begin thinking about the [[ethics]] of [[science]], as well as the progression of how far experiments have come.
