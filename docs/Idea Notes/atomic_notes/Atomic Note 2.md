I think about the [[cruelty]] towards human/animals back in the 18/19th centuries, and it is an incredibly thought provoking topic. I touched on this is my 5th source note, but it remains a fascinating topic that I didn't see myself resonating with. It was done in the name of [[science]], but came at the cost of others suffering and through questionable moral practices. Was it neccesary for the advancement of science? Can we trace the exact steps from early vivisection, all the way to the devellopment of electricity, to the creation of the [[internet]]? Who would have thought that the acts performed at that time would have had a major snowball effect into the giant entity in all of our lives today?
