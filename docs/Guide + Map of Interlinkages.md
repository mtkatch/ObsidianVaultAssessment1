Hi! I reorganized the Source Notes so now it should be a bit more clear for which part of the memex they belong to (1-3), plus I've put my Idea notes all together in the same folder. I've also added a short summary for my source notes. I've tried to attach the photo of my map of interlinkages here as well, although I've had real trouble getting it to work. Hopefully this will work, otherwise I migth e-mail it to you if it does not go through. Thank you!
