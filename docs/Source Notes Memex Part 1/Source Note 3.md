Another article focusing on the importance and significance of [[physicality]], and the effects of physically manipulating something. This study did an excellent job oh highlighting the benefits of physicality offline, as well as going over virtual manipulation and explaining the benefits to that method as well. An exploratory and helpful piece overall, it allows the reader to reflect on their own experiences with learning and, especially for students, how their learning will continue to look.

## Source 
> This study addresses the issues of evaluating the effectiveness of physicaland virtual manipulations and suggests a new way of considering physicalityin learning when compared with virtual manipulation in simulation. This studyimplies that physicality should be determined not by the mode of interaction—whether it is physical or virtual, but by the essence of experiences delivered bythat interaction. In other words, even if it is delivered through virtual simulation,when the experience contains additional physicality, such as force feedback,which is a key component for learning physics and provides more embodiedexperiences, then it should be beneficial to learning. On the contrary, even thoughit is a physical manipulation, when the experience does not contain any funda-mental perceptual differences other than virtual manipulation, it would not makeany difference in learning. In conclusion, physicality should be evaluated interms of its potential to create embodiment.[^1]
