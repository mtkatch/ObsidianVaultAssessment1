The paper talks about the idea of packet switching, and how it revolutionized data [[communication]] networks by allowing multiple users to share a single transmission line. It has become the standard for low-speed data communication networks.

This is relevant, as it highlights [[innovation]] in the field. Now that the basis has been set and there is more or less a baseline in terms of [[technology]], there is now a diverse way of thinking when it comes to achieving the desired result. Very cool to see the progress and diversity in this system!

> Packet switching was first demonstrated publicly at the first International Conference on ComputerCommunications (ICCC) in Washington, DC, in October 1972. Robert Kahn of BBN organized thedemonstration. He installed a complete ARPANET node at the conference hotel, with about 40 activeterminals permitting access to dozens of computers all over the U.S. This public demonstration was formany, if not most, of the ICCC attendees proof that packet switching really worked. It was difficult formany experienced professionals at that time to accept the fact that a collection of computers, wide-handcircuits, and minicomputer switching nodes-pieces of equipment totaling well over a hundred could allfunction together reliably, but the ARPANET demonstration lasted for three days and clearly displayed itsreliable operation in public. The network provided ultra-reliable service to thousands of attendees duringthe entire length of the conference.[^1]
