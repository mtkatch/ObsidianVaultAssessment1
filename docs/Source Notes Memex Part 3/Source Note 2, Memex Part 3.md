# Why the [[Arpanet]] Was Built
URL: https://muse.jhu.edu/article/449299/pdf?casa_token=vSBVKhrDLEwAAAAA:Dg5Bks0V_tZDlEsmNaopWQxgMmgaTL9BgZ8fs19nq7Ppo8Xu0OUZS4jZK6ElK4G1eS0GGEyvHA

This article overviews when the Department of Defense dedicated resources for research and development of the first operational packet-switched network, called Arpanet. They wanted to use it for military command and control against nuclear threats, and to help with military decision making. 

This stood out to me, as it’s a major ripple effect of the [[nuclear]] bomb. They truly opened a Pandora’s box when they developed the nuclear bomb, as it led to the creation of [[Arpanet]], which in turn led to the [[internet]]. A major development in science during wartime was the catalyst for one of the most prevalent forces in the world today.

> Even before the first Soviet nuclear weapontest, the newly established Air Force saw theneed to address its strategic role in the projec-tion of US power. In 1948, at the beginningof the Cold War, Soviet aims in Europewere becoming clear. The Air Force recog-nized the need to enlist the US scientificand technical community. One part of thisprocess was the establishment of the RANDCorporation.10 This new ‘‘think tank’’ lookedinto issues such as bombing accuracy, air-to-air combat, and the operation of air defensecenters. This work, involving both mathemat-ical analysis and analog simulation facilities,was done in the System Research Labora-tory.11 SRL eventually undertook softwareproduction for the SAGE system but had tospin it off to a new organization, the SDC,when it became too large an effort for RANDto manage. RAND did, however, continuetechnology efforts such as a pen tablet andhandwriting recognition to facilitate man-machine interaction[^1]
