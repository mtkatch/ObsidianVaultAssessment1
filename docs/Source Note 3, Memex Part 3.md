# Technological Leapfrogging: Lessons from the U.S. Video Game Console Industry
URL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/41166174?casa_token=XxniRymigUcAAAAA:Z5tAJez1dmAsGgnq5jACoFfQiiw-acX2UFcoapkZ55r2VnI98IitxUxinfzIINCpHpccZWSYx-Ik

This article discusses the video game console industry as an example of successful and unsuccessful attempts at breaking the superiority of a specific established product, and delves deeper into specific consoles and their results.

This article also captured the early craze and major success of the Atari console, which was referred to in the slides. The Atari console sold billions and billions of dollars worth, asd it was revolutionary at the time. Nowadays, it wouldn’t even be considered a very good app on a smartphone! Very interesting seeing both how [[innovation]] is relative to what's produced around it, how it compares to current day innovations, and the potential for us to look back in a few decades from now and minimize the innovations of today.

> In 1972, Nolan Bushnell founded Atari and introduced “Pong,” a ping-pong-like game that was played on a user’s television set with the aid of theAtari console. In its first year, “Pong” earned over $1 million in revenues.“Pong,” and over sixty similar knock-offs, soon flooded the market. The creationof large-scale integrated circuits enabled the systems to be fast and yet producedinexpensively. “Pong” dominated the market until Atari’s 1977 introduction ofthe Atari Video Computer System (VCS, later renamed the 2600), which wouldlead the second generation of video games. 7 The VCS/2600 utilized a micropro-cessor, and could play multiple games. The console sold for $200, with gamesselling for between $20 and $40. Atari sold over $5 billion worth of 2600 sys-tems and products by 1983. The height of this generation saw yearly sales of $3billion in the United States alone.8 However, the 1976 acquisition of Atari byWarner Communications had also turnedthe company’s focus more to developingpersonal computers. The next few yearssaw a variety of Atari computer introduc-tions, but none would prove to be bigmoney makers for Atari. While Atari’s attention was diverted towards comput-ers, Coleco entered the market and introduced the Coleco Vision video gamesystem in 1982. The Coleco Vision was very successful, and in 1983 ColecoVision games outsold Atari games.Technological Leapfrogging: Lessons from the U.S.Video Game Console IndustryCALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW VOL. 45, NO. 3 SPRING 2003 7Melissa A.
