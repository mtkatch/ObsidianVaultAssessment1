This was a very helpful article as it focuses on assemblage theory; a concept that was touched on throughout the very first in-class lecture. This article helps me and my grasp on assemblage theory, and how it connects with the idea of the [[internet]] as a whole. Prior to this course, it seemed the internet was one singular entity that people could use. However, assemblage theory corrects that idea, demonstrating how instead, the internet is a a constantly changing and evolving assemblage of components that interact and adapt.

> Guattari observes that what is crucial about this pieceof sculpture is the fact that it does not work. He means this quiteliterally. The working parts, its cogs and wheels and so on, do not turnor intermesh with one another in a mechanical fashion. It is precisely forthat reason, he argues, that it works as a piece of art (Guattari 1995:120). It works by creating an association (that is, a refrain) betweenthe human dancer and the inhuman machine, and thereby brings theminto a new kind of relation which Deleuze and Guattari would later callthe assemblage, but in their first works they called the desiring-machine.[^1]
