I thought this was a great article, and one that touched heavily on what we learned in class. Learning more and more about physicality, space, and digitization has been eye-opening and allows me to understand new perspectives I wouldn't have before. Physical determinations were never something I'd considered in my everyday life, and understanding trends as they relate to tangibility is key to what the course is trying to say.

> We may think of space asabstract and non-physical, yet livedspace is physical. We cannot escapespatiality; we are spatial beings. Welive and meet each other in space.The tangible objects in an interfaceexist in this “real” space that we livein and become part of this space.Big objects may contribute to struc-turing the space, changing how it isinterpreted. Movement and percep-tion are tightly coupled. Since weinterpret spatial qualities in relationto our own body, spatial relationsattain psychological meaning. Aroom that we encounter for the firsttime and know nothing about mayhave a specific atmosphere andinvite a particular kind of usage.Architects and interior designersare experts in designing space todo this. This does not imply thatwe are physically determined (thisrather is like a field of intersect-ing forces) [9]. Real space is alwaysinhabited and situated, becomingplace. Over time, by inhabitingspace, we appropriate it, interpretit, and give it further meaning. Therelation is bidirectional. Peoplemight identify existing physicalaffordances for new uses of a givenplace (think of skateboarding andparcours), which then changes itsmeaning through the new (sociallyand culturally defined) use.[^1]
