Towards the end of one of the lectures regarding [[electricity]], the concept of [[cruelty]] in the 18/19th century was brought up and it had a lasting impact on me. I found it to be a very interesting and questionable topic, that had to do with ethics, progress, and ambiguity. This was a difficult time, and the science was still so new. Learning about the process of imposing regulations to what could and could not be performed in a scientific experiment was fascinating, and I felt this article was able to capture the a morally gray area in the field of science very well.

Hehad, in effect, provided concrete evidence that mental functions were localized at definitesites within the brain, and could be mapped. The results spread quickly, and were widelydiscussed by leading figures in the scientific and lay communities, attracting both praise andcriticism aplenty.13 Spurred on by his success, Ferrier carried out more tests on dogs, jackals,cats and macaques paid for by, and operated on at, the Royal Society of London throughout1873.[^1]
