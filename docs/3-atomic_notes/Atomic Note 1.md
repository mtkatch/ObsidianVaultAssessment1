Just a few thoughts on the concept of [[physicality]]. It's a concept I never truly gave the nessecary time and energy to, as I never really understood it's significance or purpose before. However, in this day and age, it's more important than ever. With more and more reliance and dependability on the [[internet]] and online platforms, it's paramount to understand how we're slowly and slowly transferring everything we have to online facilities. I think about my own camera roll on my phone. I own WAY more photos and videos on my photo app than I own physically! All my accounts, my essays, papers, e-mails... It's scary to think about!
