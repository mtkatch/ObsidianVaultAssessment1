This passage discusses the challenges of using peers in peer-to-peer systems such as file-sharing applications.  It goes over some characteristics of this, such as bandwidth and duration of [[connection]], that must be taken into account to ensure the connection to be efficient and reliable.

What good is the internet if not to connect with others? Whether it be texting or email, [[information]] sharing, games, etc. All content needs to be shared and replicated with everyone! File-sharing is an element that I never thought of, but is crucial to the well-running of the internet, and connecting with others. Always neat reading and learning more about this process and some of the challenges that they faced while developing the system.

> th Napster and Gnutella have similar goals: to facil-itate the location and exchange of files (typically images,audio, or video) between a large group of independent usersconnected through the Internet. In both of these systems,the files are stored on the computers of the individual usersor peers, and they are exchanged through a direct connec-tion between the downloading and uploading peers, over anHTTP-style protocol. All peers in this system are sym-metric, in that they all have the ability to function bothas a client and a server. This symmetry is one attributethat distinguishes peer-to-peer systems from many conven-tional distributed system architectures. Though the processof exchanging files is similar in both systems, Napster andGnutella differ substantially in how peers locate files (Fig-ure 1)[^1]
