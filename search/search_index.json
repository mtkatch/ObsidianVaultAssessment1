This poses questions regaridng ethics, progress, innovation, and the danger that could potentially come with it. - website/Idea Notes/Idea Note-Oppeneheimer This ties into a key idea and topic from my studies.

[1]In 1852 Frederick N. Gisborne laid the first deep-sea cable in North America between NewBrunswick and Prince Edward Island. Gisborne had proposed another cable between New York and St.John\u2019s that would form a relay system where messages would be sent by telegraph to St. John\u2019s andthen carried by boat to Europe and vice versa. Construction of this system was halted when Gisborneencountered financial difficulty crossing the rough interior of Newfoundland. Gisborne travelled toNew York looking for more investors to complete the project where he met Cyrus W. Field. Field tookover the project and immediately began investigating the feasibility of a transatlantic cable betweenNewfoundland and Ireland. [2][3]Field founded the New York, Newfoundland and London Electric Telegraph Company in 1854and finished cable between New York and Newfoundland by 1856. It was then demonstrated using therelay scheme that 2 to 3 days could be saved transmitting messages across the Atlantic Ocean whichshowed the potential of a transatlantic cable and garnered more interest in the project. Field thenfounded the Atlantic Telegraph Company where William Thompson (Lord Kelvin) and WildmanWhitehouse became involved.

He installed a complete ARPANET node at the conference hotel, with about 40 activeterminals permitting access to dozens of computers all over the U.S. This public demonstration was formany, if not most, of the ICCC attendees proof that packet switching really worked. It was difficult formany experienced professionals at that time to accept the fact that a collection of computers, wide-handcircuits, and minicomputer switching nodes-pieces of equipment totaling well over a hundred could allfunction together reliably, but the ARPANET demonstration lasted for three days and clearly displayed itsreliable operation in public.

The console sold for $200, with gamesselling for between $20 and $40. Atari sold over $5 billion worth of 2600 sys-tems and products by 1983. The height of this generation saw yearly sales of $3billion in the United States alone.8 However, the 1976 acquisition of Atari byWarner Communications had also turnedthe company\u2019s focus more to developingpersonal computers.

Moreover, they may lead the science, economy, business and so on to facebadly risk [21]. A student, which is from Cornell University, compiled a code called as worm virus in 1988. The spread of thiscode bring about thousands of computers to shut down [12]. And then, CodeRed and Nimda virus caused several billion eco-nomical loss, when they diffused in the internet [3,13]. In 2003, a virus called 2003 worm King, rapidly spread and attackedthe global world, which resulted the network of the internet to be seriously blocked and servers to be paralyzed [17]. What ismore serious is that the internet users can not send or receive email, book plane tickets, use credit card to pay for anything. In2007, the report of pestilence about computer virus in China revealed, infection rate of computer virus in China is more than90% [5].Computer virus is a malicious mobile code which including virus, worm, trojan horses, logic bomb and so on [1,10,16].Different codes have different ways to spread in the internet. Virus mainly attack the file system and worm uses system vul-nerability to search and attack the computer. And for trojan horses, they camouflage themselves and thus induce the users todownload them. There are a variety of computer virus, but they all have infectivity, invisibility, latent, destructibility andunpredictability [7]. The word \u2018\u2018latent\u201d means that the virus hide themselves in the computer and spread them in the inter-net while the users can not notice them.Cohen pointed out that, there are a great many similarity between computer virus and biological virus [4]. From the bio-logical point of view, the spread of virus is similar to sexually disease, worm is similar to flu and logic bomb is similar to HIV[14]. Kephart used the epidemic models to find out the rule in the computer virus [8,9] and he focused his attention on theeffect of topological structure of the network on the spread of the virus.The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present a computer virus model with latent by using the theory inepidemic models and interpret the biological meaning of these parameters of the model.1</p> <p>tags:  links: - broader terms (BT): - narrower terms (NT): - related terms (RT): - used for (UF) or aliases: connected ideas: MOC:  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Dynamical behavior of computer virus on Internet | syndication link \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Note%201/","title":"Note 1","text":"<p>Example: link to Mermaid Diagrams under <code>Features</code></p>"},{"location":"Topic%201/Note%202/","title":"Note 2","text":""}]}
